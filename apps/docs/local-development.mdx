## Introduction

Loopearn's codebase is set up in a monorepo via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://git.new/Loopearn).

Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── api
├── business
├── docs
├── mobile
├── website
packages
├── documents
├── email
├── events
├── import
├── inbox
├── jobs
├── kv
├── location
├── notification
├── supabase
├── tsconfig
├── ui
├── utils
```

The `apps` directory contains the code for:

- `api`: The backend for Loopearn (supabase).
- `business`: Loopearn's application ([business.loopearn.com](https://business.loopearn.com)).
- `docs`: Loopearn's documentation site ([loopearn.com/docs](https://loopearn.com/docs)).
- `mobile`: Loopearn's mobile app.
- `website`: Loopearn's website app ([loopearn.com](https://loopearn.com)).

The `packages` directory contains the code for:

- `documents`: OCR for receipts.
- `events`: Analytics library.
- `kv`: Key value storage client.
- `location`: Location related utils.
- `notification`: Notifications client.
- `supabase`: Queries and client.
- `tsconfig`: The TypeScript configuration for Loopearn's web app.
- `ui`: UI component library.
- `utils`: A collection of utility functions and constants used across Loopearn's codebase.
